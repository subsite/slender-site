## Free Projects

Here's some projects that I've done in my free time. Feel free to use!

## SnapshotBackup

An incremental backup script for creating time freezed snapshots. Works on Linux-like systems only, tested on Ubuntu and Debian. Written in bash, uses rsync and some standard shell commands.

## Misc Scripts

I, as most other Linux admins, tend to write small scripts for miscellaneous tasks. I now maintain some of them on GitHub to be able to conveniently run the same version on different hosts. Feel free to download or fork these if you find them useful.
