##SubSite

Founded in 2009, IT Consultant Company SubSite specialises in dynamic web solutions and system integration. Our goal is to provide solutions where all data is optimised, dynamic and consistent.
 

##Streamlining data management

Today's organisations depend on powerful information systems. Product information, client data and business economics is stored in databases, and managing this mass of data requires considerable effort and resources.

SubSite's integrated data solutions will help streamline information systems, so that data from different systems can be used efficiently on different media without multiple updating requirements. A web shop, for instance, should automatically update products, prices and stock information from the company's ERP system, and consequently save time and resources while ensuring consistent and up to date information at all times.
