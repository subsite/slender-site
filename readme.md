## About

This is a simple Angular2 website framework for no-nonsense sites with nothing but content.

**Features**
- Very short source code
- Two level navigational hierarchy
- Markdown parsing using *marked.js*
- Sample css 

**Why?**
This is really a testbead for Angular2, but it also runs the production site http://www.subsite.fi/in-english

## Installation

Clone the repository, then launch the demo site with

    npm install
    npm start


## ToDo

- Code restructuring, probably
- Make navigational depth unlimited
- Swap ot marked.js to Angular2 library when available
- Use upcoming new features of Angular2
